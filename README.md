# Odin CSS/HTML Project: Homepage

## Description of Project

In this project we are tasked with making a responsive website that will feature 3 layouts.

The 3 layouts will target: 

1. Mobile devices
2. Tablets
3. Desktop computers

## My Goals

I will focus on honing these CSS skills:

* Responsive web design with Flexbox and Grid
* Maintainable and terse CSS (separation of layout classes from styling classes)
  * For concrete elements use BEM for names (eg "header__menu-item")
  * For styling use utility classes (eg ".clr-accent")
  * Use as few media queries as possible (3 in this case)

I will also focus on these HTML skills:

* Responsive images
  * Use of <img srcset> to provide multiples of the same image
  * Use of <picture> to provide "art direction" (cropping) for one image
* Proper usage of semantic HTML tags
